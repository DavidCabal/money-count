### How It Works
You simply input what you make hourly along with an optional motivational message. Money Count then calculates and updates how much you have made each minute and displays this number. (along with your motivational message) If you are needing an extra boost on those long nights of extra work, my goal with this app was to do just that by providing a quick little reminder each minute.
